### DriverFoundry
#### A nod to working with Linux block devices and "crafting" our own drivers.

 ðŸ”­ In the vast, unexplored depths of the digital cosmos, where electrons hum and invisible forces drive the machinery of modern life, lies a world few have dared to ventureâ€”a world of kernels, devices, and drivers, whose intricate workings govern the very fabric of our technological existence.

âš¡ It is into this realm that KernelCraft embarks, a grand voyage of discovery not unlike the intrepid journeys chronicled by explorers of old. But this is no oceanic voyage nor a subterranean descent; it is a quest into the very heart of the machine itself. From the towering heights of the Linux kernel to the mysterious workings of virtual devices, our expedition will chart a course through uncharted territories, guided by tools of ingenuity: Buildroot, to forge a living root from the source, and QEMU, a virtual ship of boundless possibilities.

ðŸŒ± In this project, the curious adventurer will set forth to uncover the secrets of block devices and Virtioâ€”those enigmatic mechanisms that power the unseen engines of modern systems. Each experiment, each driver built, will be a step closer to unlocking the mysteries of how machine and code intertwine, a frontier of knowledge waiting to be tamed.

Thus, KernelCraft begins its expedition into the unknownâ€”where the goal is not simply to understand, but to master the devices that shape our digital world. In this odyssey, we shall learn how they live, how they breathe, and ultimately, how they obey our command.

My current work focuses on the [XAPI toolstack](https://xapi-project.github.io/new-docs/), the management layer for the Xen hypervisor, including its APIs, orchestration capabilities, and integration with storage and networking subsystems.
